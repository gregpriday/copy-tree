# Integrating Open Source Projects with Ctree and AI: Using GitHub URLs

Ctree's ability to directly process GitHub URLs opens up powerful workflows for interacting with open-source projects, especially when combined with AI assistants like Claude. This feature allows you to quickly copy specific parts of a repository—or even the entire project—to your clipboard, making it easy to get the code context you need into your AI's context window.

## Why Use GitHub URLs with Ctree?

When working with open-source projects, you often need to:

*   **Understand specific parts of a project:** You might want to learn how a particular module works, analyze the implementation of a specific feature, or understand the project's overall architecture.
*   **Integrate open-source code into your project:** You may want to reuse a component, adapt a library, or build upon an existing solution.
*   **Debug integration issues:** When incorporating open-source code, you might encounter compatibility problems or unexpected behavior that requires in-depth analysis.
*   **Get help from AI assistants:** AI tools like Claude can provide valuable assistance with understanding, integrating, and debugging code, but they need the right context to be effective.

Ctree's GitHub URL support, combined with its powerful filtering capabilities, streamlines these tasks by enabling you to precisely select the parts of a project you need and share them with your AI assistant.

## How to Use GitHub URLs

The basic syntax for using GitHub URLs with Ctree is:

```bash
ctree <GitHub URL> [options]
```

**Example:**

To copy the entire `src` directory from the `main` branch of a repository:

```bash
ctree https://github.com/username/repository/tree/main/src
```

**Breakdown of the URL structure:**

*   `https://github.com/`: The base URL for GitHub.
*   `username/repository`: The username and repository name.
*   `/tree/main`: Specifies the `main` branch (you can change this to any branch name).
*   `/src`: The path to the directory you want to copy (optional).

**Supported URL Formats:**

Ctree supports the following GitHub URL formats:

*   **Repository root:** `https://github.com/username/repository` (copies the entire repository from the **default branch**, typically `main` or `master`)
*   **Specific branch:** `https://github.com/username/repository/tree/branch-name`
*   **Subdirectory:** `https://github.com/username/repository/tree/branch-name/path/to/directory`
*   **Specific file (not recommended):** `https://github.com/username/repository/blob/branch-name/path/to/file.ext` (While technically possible, using `ctree` to copy a single file is often unnecessary; use directory paths to provide context to the AI.)

**Note:** Ctree automatically handles the `.git` extension when constructing the clone URL.

## Leveraging Ctree's Features with GitHub URLs

You can combine GitHub URL support with Ctree's other powerful features to tailor the output for your specific needs:

### 1. Filtering with the `--filter` Option (Glob Patterns)

The `--filter` option allows you to use glob patterns to include only specific files or directories based on their paths. This is useful when you know the structure of the repository and want to target files based on their names or locations.

```bash
# Copy only JavaScript files from the 'src' directory
ctree https://github.com/username/repository/tree/main/src --filter="*.js"

# Copy all files from directories named 'tests' or 'specs'
ctree https://github.com/username/repository --filter="tests/**" --filter="specs/**"

# Copy only TypeScript and Markdown files from the entire repository
ctree https://github.com/username/repository --filter="*.ts" --filter="*.md"
```

You can use `--filter` multiple times to specify different patterns.

### 2. AI-Powered Filtering (Recommended)

The `--ai-filter` option lets you use natural language to describe the files you want to include. This is particularly useful when you're not familiar with the project's structure or when you need to find files based on their content or purpose.

```bash
# Copy all files related to user authentication
ctree https://github.com/username/repository --ai-filter "Find all files related to user authentication"

# Copy files that deal with database migrations
ctree https://github.com/username/repository --ai-filter "Files related to database migrations and models"
```

This is often the **most effective way to filter open-source projects** when using Ctree with an AI assistant, as it allows the AI to understand the context and select relevant files even if you are not familiar with the project.

### 3. Using Custom Rulesets

While open-source projects are unlikely to have predefined Ctree rulesets, you can create your own custom rulesets to filter GitHub repositories effectively. You can use either predefined rulesets (for known project types) or create custom ruleset files and specify their paths using the `--ruleset` option.

**a. Using Predefined Rulesets:**

If the GitHub repository matches a known project type (e.g., Laravel, SvelteKit), you can use Ctree's built-in rulesets:

```bash
# Copy only files relevant to a Laravel project
ctree https://github.com/username/laravel-project --ruleset=laravel
```

**b. Using Custom Ruleset Files:**

For more control, create a custom ruleset file (e.g., `my-rules.json`) and use the `--ruleset` option followed by the *path* to your ruleset file. You can use either an absolute path or a path relative to your current working directory:

```bash
# Use a custom ruleset file named my-rules.json in your home directory
ctree https://github.com/username/repository --ruleset=~/my-rules.json

# Use a custom ruleset file named my-project-rules.json in the current directory
ctree https://github.com/username/repository --ruleset=./my-project-rules.json

# Use a custom ruleset file named special-rules.json in a subdirectory
ctree https://github.com/username/repository --ruleset=rulesets/special-rules.json
```

**Example `my-rules.json`:**

```json
{
  "rules": [
    [
      ["folder", "startsWith", "src"],
      ["extension", "oneOf", ["js", "ts"]]
    ],
    [
      ["folder", "startsWith", "docs"]
    ]
  ],
  "globalExcludeRules": [
    ["folder", "contains", "node_modules"]
  ]
}
```

**4. Depth and Line Limits**

You can also control the depth of the copied tree and the number of lines per file:

```bash
# Copy only the top-level directories and files from a branch
ctree https://github.com/username/repository/tree/develop --depth=1

# Limit the output to the first 20 lines of each file
ctree https://github.com/username/repository/tree/main/src --max-lines=20
```

### 6. Output Options

Display the output, save it to a file, or stream it to another command:

```bash
# Display the tree structure in the console
ctree https://github.com/username/repository --display --only-tree

# Save the output to a file with an AI-generated name
ctree https://github.com/username/repository -o

# Stream the output to another command
ctree https://github.com/username/repository --stream | other-command
```

## Smart Caching for Efficiency

Ctree intelligently caches GitHub repositories to avoid redundant downloads.

*   **Cache Location:** Repositories are cached in `~/.copytree/cache/repos`.
*   **Automatic Updates:** Ctree checks for updates and pulls the latest changes if the cached repository is outdated.
*   **Cache Invalidation:** The cache is invalidated when you switch branches or use a different subpath within the same repository.
*   **Manual Cache Management:**
    *   `ctree --clear-cache`: Clears the entire GitHub cache.
    *   `ctree <GitHub URL> --no-cache`: Bypasses the cache for a specific operation.

## Example Workflow: Integrating an Open-Source Library

Let's say you want to integrate a specific component from an open-source React library into your project. Here's how you could use Ctree and Claude:

1. **Find the relevant code:**

    ```bash
    # Copy the component's directory from the library's GitHub repository
    ctree https://github.com/library-author/react-library/tree/main/src/components/TargetComponent -o
    ```
2. **Provide context to Claude:**

    *   Open the file that was saved in `~/.copytree/files/`
    *   "I want to use the `TargetComponent` from this React library in my project. Here's the component's code: [Paste file content]. My project uses [Describe your project's framework, version, and relevant details]. Can you help me understand how to integrate this component?"
3. **Iterate with Claude:**

    *   Ask specific questions about the component's props, dependencies, and usage.
    *   Request code examples for integrating the component into your project.
    *   Get help troubleshooting any integration issues.

## Tips for Working with Claude

*   **Provide clear context:** Explain your project's setup, the specific part of the open-source project you're interested in, and what you're trying to achieve.
*   **Use specific prompts:** Ask targeted questions to get the most relevant answers.
*   **Iterate and refine:** Don't be afraid to ask follow-up questions or provide feedback to guide Claude towards the desired solution.
*   **Verify Claude's suggestions:** While Claude is a powerful tool, it's essential to review and test any code it generates before using it in your project.

## Conclusion

Ctree's GitHub URL support simplifies the process of working with open-source code, especially when combined with AI assistants like Claude. By enabling you to quickly extract and share relevant parts of a repository, Ctree helps you leverage the power of AI for code understanding, integration, and problem-solving. Experiment with different combinations of Ctree options and AI prompts to discover the most effective workflows for your needs.
