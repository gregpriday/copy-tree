#### 2. AI-Powered Market Research with Gemini Deep Research

1. **Define Research Scope:**
    *   Clearly outline your business idea and the key areas you need to research (e.g., market size, target audience, competitors, pricing models, technology trends).

2. **Formulate Advanced Research Queries:**
    *   Craft specific, detailed prompts for Gemini's Deep Research feature. Access this at [https://gemini.google.com/](https://gemini.google.com/) and utilize the `/research` command.
    *   **Example Prompts:**
        >   "Using Deep Research, provide an in-depth analysis of the market for [your industry/niche], including market size, growth rate, key trends, and major players. Focus on the segment related to [your specific product/service] and identify any emerging opportunities or threats."
        >
        >   "Using Deep Research, identify and analyze the top 5-7 competitors in the [your industry/niche] market. For each competitor, provide a detailed overview of their product/service offerings, pricing models, target audience, marketing strategies, and strengths and weaknesses. Also, include any available data on their market share, revenue, and customer reviews."
        >
        >   "Using Deep Research, what are the current trends and emerging technologies in [your industry/niche]? Analyze the potential impact of these trends on the market and identify opportunities for innovation."
        >
        >   "Using Deep Research, research and analyze the most effective customer acquisition channels for [your target audience]. Provide data on the average customer acquisition cost (CAC) and customer lifetime value (CLTV) for each channel."
        >
        >   "Using Deep Research, what are the key security and compliance considerations for businesses operating in [your industry/niche]? Analyze the relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA) and identify best practices for ensuring data privacy and security."

3. **Execute Deep Research:**
    *   Submit your queries to Gemini Deep Research using the `/research` command in the Gemini web interface.

4. **Organize Research Findings:**
    *   **Create Google Docs:** For each research topic, create a dedicated Google Doc to store the raw output from Gemini Deep Research.
    *   **Export to Markdown:** Export each Google Doc as a Markdown file.
    *   **Save in `research` directory:** Place the Markdown files within the `research` folder of your project directory (e.g., `research/market-analysis.md`, `research/competitor-analysis.md`, `research/technology-trends.md`).

#### 3. Develop Core Business Plan Components

1. **Provide Gemini with Full Context:**
    *   `cd my-business-plan`
    *   `ctree -o` (Copies the entire project directory to your clipboard). You can choose between Gemini at [gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com) and Google AI Studio at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com). Use Google AI Studio if you want to attach the files directly, or use the standard interface for copy and paste. If using the standard interface and you hit the token limit, follow the instructions for creating a ruleset in section 3.2.
    *   Paste the content into a new Gemini chat (preferably using Google AI Studio for the largest context window, or directly paste into the standard Gemini interface if the content is small enough). This provides Gemini with access to all your research and any existing plan documents.

2. **Instruct Gemini:**
    *   "Based on the research provided, help me create a comprehensive business plan. Let's start with the [Section Name] section. Draft an outline and then we will refine it together."

3. **Iterative Refinement:**
    *   Review Gemini's output, provide feedback, and ask clarifying questions.
    *   Request revisions and expansions until the section meets your standards.
    *   Use `ctree -o` again to copy specific research files or other documents for focused discussions (e.g., `cd research`, then `ctree competitor-analysis.md -o` when discussing competitive positioning, and paste into Gemini).
    *   You can also use `ctree` to copy relevant code snippets if you are discussing technical aspects of your plan.

4. **Repeat for Each Section:** Follow steps 3.1 to 3.4 for each major section of your business plan, saving the refined content in separate Markdown files within the `plan` directory.

**Suggested Business Plan Sections:**

*   **Executive Summary:** A concise overview of the business plan.
*   **Company Description:** Details about your company's mission, vision, and values.
*   **Market Analysis:** In-depth analysis of the target market, including size, trends, and customer needs.
*   **Organization & Management:** Structure of your team and their roles and responsibilities.
*   **Service or Product Line:** Detailed description of your product/service and its unique value proposition.
*   **Marketing & Sales Strategy:** Outline of your marketing and sales plans to reach your target audience.
*   **Funding Request (if applicable):** Details on the funding requirements and how the funds will be used.
*   **Financial Projections:** Forecasted revenue, expenses, and profitability for the next 3-5 years.
*   **Appendix:** Supporting documents, such as market research data, resumes of key team members, and letters of intent.

#### 3.2 Using Rulesets for Large Projects

If your project exceeds Gemini's context window, even when using AI Studio, you'll need to create rulesets to provide focused context:

1. **Identify Key Sections:** Determine which sections of your project are most relevant to the current task.
2. **Create a Ruleset:**
    *   Create a new file in your project's root directory named `.ctree/rulesets/[ruleset_name].json`.
    *   Define rules to include specific files or folders based on glob patterns.
    *   Example `image-processing.json` ruleset:

        ```json
        {
          "rules": [
            [
              ["folder", "startsWith", "research/"],
              ["basename", "oneOf", ["image-formats.md", "compression-analysis.md"]]
            ],
            [
              ["path", "startsWith", "plan/technology-strategy.md"]
            ],
            [
              ["path", "startsWith", "team/founder/technical-background.md"]
            ]
          ]
        }
        ```

3. **Use the Ruleset with `ctree`:**
    *   `ctree --ruleset=[ruleset_name] -o` (e.g., `ctree --ruleset=image-processing -o`)
4. **Provide Context to Gemini:** Paste the output into Gemini, along with your specific instructions.

#### 4. Develop Additional Supporting Documents and Systems

1. **Full Project Context for Gemini:**
    *   Run `ctree -o` from your project's root directory.
    *   Paste the output into Gemini to give it access to your entire project structure and all existing documents.

2. **Collaborate with Gemini:** Instruct Gemini to create outlines, draft content, and refine existing sections for these additional documents. Utilize its large context window to reference all existing information.

3. **Iterative Refinement:** Work with Gemini to refine each document until it meets your standards.

4. **Save and Organize:** Save each document in the appropriate directory within your project using Markdown format.

**Suggested Supporting Documents and Systems:**

*   **`overview.md`:** High-level overview of the project, its goals, and key strategies.
*   **`branding/`**: Documents related to brand strategy, including:
    *   Guidelines for brand voice, messaging, and visual identity.
    *   Marketing materials and templates.
*   **`team/`**: Information about the project team, including:
    *   `founder/` (or other team member directories):
        *   `overview.md`:  Team member's professional profile, experience, and role within the project.
        *   Documents detailing individual work patterns, decision-making frameworks, etc. (Adapt these to your team's needs - they can be much briefer than Greg's personal documents).
*   **`financial/`**: Financial planning and analysis documents, such as:
    *   Pricing strategy documents.
    *   Key performance indicators (KPIs) to track.
    *   Financial principles and guidelines.
*   **`processes/`**: Documentation of key business processes, including:
    *   Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for various tasks.
    *   Workflow diagrams (created with Mermaid, as described below).
    *   Guidelines for using specific tools or technologies.
*   **`strategy/`**: High-level strategic planning documents, including:
    *   Long-term goals and objectives.
    *   Go-to-market strategies.
    *   Contingency plans.
    *   **`research-methodology.md`:** Guidelines for using Gemini for research.

#### 5. Create Processes with Mermaid Diagrams

1. **Identify Key Processes:** Determine the core processes within your business that need to be documented (e.g., development workflow, customer support, marketing campaign execution, content creation pipeline).
2. **Outline Process Steps:** Break down each process into sequential steps.
3. **Generate Mermaid Diagrams:**
    *   Use `ctree -o` to copy relevant code, research findings, or sections of the business plan to provide context.
    *   Instruct Gemini to create a Mermaid diagram representing the process flow.
    *   Example prompt:
        >   "Here is the current outline for our new feature development process and all the supporting documentation from the business plan:\
        >   [Paste `ctree -o` output here]\
        >   Please generate a Mermaid diagram that visually represents this workflow."
4. **Refine and Clarify:** Review the generated diagrams, provide feedback to Gemini, and request revisions until the diagrams accurately reflect the process.
5. **Save and Integrate:** Save the Mermaid diagrams as `.mmd` files in the `processes` directory and consider integrating them into your project documentation or internal wiki.

#### 6. Continuous Refinement and Expansion

1. **Regular Reviews:** Periodically review and update your business plan and operational system, incorporating new data, feedback, and insights from Gemini.
2. **Expand Documentation:** As your business grows, continue to expand your documentation, adding new sections and documents as needed.
3. **Iterate with Gemini:** Use Gemini to analyze your progress, identify areas for improvement, and refine your strategies.

### Example Workflow: Creating a Competitor Analysis Document

1. **Initial Research:**
    *   Use Gemini Deep Research with a prompt like: "Using Deep Research, conduct a comprehensive analysis of the top 5 competitors in the [your industry/niche] market, including their pricing models, key features, target audience, and marketing strategies. Also include any significant open-source alternatives. Provide sources for all data."
    *   Save the output as a Google Doc, then export it as `research/competitor-analysis.md`.

2. **Refine with `ctree` and Gemini:**
    *   `cd research`
    *   `ctree -o` (Copies the entire `research` directory to the clipboard)
    *   Paste the content into Gemini.
    *   Prompt: "Based on this initial competitor analysis, and all the other research in this folder, help me create a detailed table comparing their pricing tiers, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses, and identifying potential opportunities for differentiation. Also, create a SWOT analysis for each competitor."
    *   Iteratively refine the table and SWOT analyses with Gemini's assistance.

3. **Integrate into Business Plan:**
    *   Copy the refined table and analysis from Gemini.
    *   Paste it into the relevant section of your business plan document (e.g., `plan/market-analysis.md`).
