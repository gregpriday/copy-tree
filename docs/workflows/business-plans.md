#### 3. Develop Core Business Plan Components

1. **Provide Full Context to AI:**
    - In your project directory, run:
      ```bash
      ctree -o
      ```
      This copies the entire project (or a targeted subset) to your clipboard.
    - Paste the content into a new session with your AI assistant (preferably using Google AI Studio if available).  
    - **Note:** For content generation (outlining and drafting), you can use either Gemini or ChatGPT. Both work well now for producing detailed business plan sections.

2. **Instruct the AI to Create a Business Plan Outline:**
    - **Example Prompt:**
      > "Based on the research provided, help me create a comprehensive business plan. Let’s start with the [Section Name] section. Draft an outline including key points and supporting details."
    - Iterate with feedback until the outline is complete.

3. **Iterative Content Generation:**
    - For each major section of your business plan, provide the AI with the necessary research context (using `ctree -o` if needed) and ask it to generate content.
    - **Example:**  
      > "Using the research data provided, draft the Market Analysis section for our business plan. Include an overview of market size, trends, competitor analysis, and growth opportunities."
    - Use either Gemini or ChatGPT for these prompts based on your preference.

4. **Repeat for All Sections:**
    - Suggested sections include:
        - **Executive Summary**
        - **Company Description**
        - **Market Analysis**
        - **Organization & Management**
        - **Service or Product Line**
        - **Marketing & Sales Strategy**
        - **Funding Request (if applicable)**
        - **Financial Projections**
        - **Appendix**

#### 3.2 Using Rulesets for Large Projects

If your project exceeds the AI’s context window—even when using AI Studio—create targeted rulesets to provide focused context:

1. **Identify Key Sections:** Determine which parts of your project are most relevant to the current task.
2. **Create a Ruleset:**  
   Create a file in `.ctree/rulesets/` (e.g., `image-processing.json`) with rules to include only the necessary files.
   ```json
   {
     "rules": [
       [
         ["folder", "startsWith", "research/"],
         ["basename", "oneOf", ["image-formats.md", "compression-analysis.md"]]
       ],
       [
         ["path", "startsWith", "plan/technology-strategy.md"]
       ],
       [
         ["path", "startsWith", "team/founder/technical-background.md"]
       ]
     ]
   }
   ```
3. **Use the Ruleset with `ctree`:**
   ```bash
   ctree --ruleset=image-processing -o
   ```
4. **Provide Context to AI:**  
   Paste the output into your AI session along with specific instructions.

---

#### 4. Develop Additional Supporting Documents and Systems

1. **Full Project Context for AI:**  
   Run:
   ```bash
   ctree -o
   ```
   and paste the output into your AI session to provide full context of your project structure.

2. **Collaborate with AI:**  
   Instruct the AI to create outlines, draft content, and refine documents for each supporting area (e.g., branding, team, financials, processes, strategy).

3. **Iterative Refinement:**  
   Work with the AI to iteratively refine each document until it meets your standards. Save the refined content as Markdown files in the appropriate directories.

**Suggested Supporting Documents:**

- **overview.md:** A high-level project overview.
- **branding/:** Brand strategy documents, guidelines, and marketing materials.
- **team/:** Profiles and documentation of team members.
- **financial/:** Pricing strategies, KPIs, and financial guidelines.
- **processes/:** SOPs, workflow diagrams (e.g., created with Mermaid), and tool usage guides.
- **strategy/:** Long-term strategic planning, goals, and contingency plans (e.g., `research-methodology.md`).

---

#### 5. Create Processes with Mermaid Diagrams

1. **Identify Key Processes:**  
   Determine core business processes to document (e.g., development workflow, customer support, marketing campaigns).
2. **Outline Process Steps:**  
   Break each process into sequential steps.
3. **Generate Mermaid Diagrams:**
    - Use:
      ```bash
      ctree -o
      ```
      to copy relevant context.
    - **Prompt Example:**
      > "Based on the following process outline:
      > [Paste copytree output here]
      > Please generate a Mermaid diagram that visually represents this workflow."
4. **Refine and Save:**  
   Revise the diagrams as needed, then save them as `.mmd` files in the `processes` directory.

---

#### 6. Continuous Refinement and Expansion

1. **Regular Reviews:**  
   Periodically review and update your business plan and supporting documents to incorporate new research, feedback, and market changes.
2. **Expand Documentation:**  
   Add new sections as your business evolves.
3. **Iterate with AI:**  
   Use Gemini (for deep research) and ChatGPT (for content generation) to analyze progress, identify improvement areas, and refine your strategies.

### Example Workflow: Creating a Competitor Analysis Document

1. **Initial Research:**
    - Use Gemini Deep Research with a prompt such as:
      > "Using Deep Research, conduct a comprehensive analysis of the top 5 competitors in the [your industry/niche] market, including their pricing models, key features, target audience, and marketing strategies. Include data on market share, revenue, and customer reviews, with sources for all data."
    - Save the output as a Google Doc and export it as `research/competitor-analysis.md`.

2. **Refinement with copytree and AI:**
    - Change directory to `research` and run:
      ```bash
      ctree -o
      ```
      The `-o` flag creates a file, which you need for some chatbots, but not others. So it's optional.
    - Paste the output into an AI session (using Gemini or ChatGPT) and prompt:
      > "Based on this competitor analysis and the other research in this folder, help me create a detailed table comparing pricing tiers, strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for differentiation for each competitor. Also, include a SWOT analysis for each competitor."
    - Refine the table and SWOT analyses iteratively with the AI.

3. **Integrate into the Business Plan:**
    - Copy the refined table and analysis from the AI.
    - Paste it into the appropriate section of your business plan document (e.g., `plan/market-analysis.md`).
