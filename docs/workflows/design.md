This document outlines an iterative, AI-assisted approach to designing web applications. By leveraging SvelteKit for project structure, Tailwind CSS for styling, and AI design partners like Claude or ChatGPT, this workflow guides you from broad initial concepts to refined, production-ready components. Using copytree to provide full project context ensures that AI suggestions are precise and relevant.

---

## 1. Introduction

This workflow harnesses the power of AI to generate design variations, refine concepts based on user feedback, and evolve your design organically. It is particularly well-suited for designers comfortable with code and collaborative approaches. Today’s LLMs—including both Claude and ChatGPT—offer robust context understanding and creative capabilities that can help drive your design process forward.

**Guiding Principles:**

- **AI as a Design Partner:** Use AI assistants like Claude or ChatGPT to generate ideas, iterate on designs, and provide constructive feedback.
- **Iterative Refinement:** Evolve your design through continuous, short feedback cycles—from high-level layouts to detailed component tweaks.
- **Component-Based Design:** Leverage SvelteKit’s modular component structure to isolate and refine individual design elements.
- **Visual and Code-Centric Feedback:** Base design decisions on both live visual output and direct code manipulation.
- **Full Context Provisioning:** Use copytree (with targeted rulesets) to supply the AI with complete project context—even for small updates—ensuring that AI feedback is accurate and relevant.

## 3. Design Workflow

### 3.1. Initial Project Setup

1. **Create a New SvelteKit Project:**

    ```bash
    npm create svelte@latest my-design-project
    cd my-design-project
    npm install
    ```

2. **Install Tailwind CSS:**

   Follow the official [Tailwind CSS installation guide for SvelteKit](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides).

3. **Establish a Basic Structure:**

   Create your initial routes (e.g., Home, About, Contact) by adding corresponding `+page.svelte` files.

---

### 3.2. Initial Design Concept

1. **Provide Project Context to Your AI Assistant:**

   Use copytree to capture the entire project structure and file previews. This full-context snapshot helps your AI assistant (Claude or ChatGPT) understand your current state and design goals.

    ```bash
    ctree
    ```

   Then share a detailed project description with your AI assistant. For example:

    ```text
    Here is my current project code:
    [Paste copytree output here]

    I'm building a website for a modern, minimalist online portfolio showcasing my photography. The design should be clean and spacious with a focus on large, high-quality images. The color scheme is predominantly monochrome with subtle accent colors. Key pages include a Home page (with a hero image and project grid), an About page, and a Contact page. Overall, the design must feel elegant, professional, and visually engaging.
    ```

2. **Request Component-Level Designs:**

   Ask your AI assistant to generate Svelte components one at a time, reiterating the project description if needed. For example:

    ```text
    Using SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS, can you design a Header component based on the project description above? Please provide complete, production-ready code.
    ```

   Similarly, prompt for a Footer, a Hero component, or other critical elements.

3. **Implement Initial Designs:**

   Create or update your Svelte components (e.g., `Header.svelte`, `Footer.svelte`, `Hero.svelte`) using the generated code as a starting point.

---

### 3.3. Iterative Refinement with copytree and AI

1. **Extract Up-to-Date Context:**

   Each time you iterate on the design, run:

    ```bash
    ctree
    ```

   This ensures your AI assistant always sees the most recent version of your project.

2. **Request Specific Refinements:**

   Paste the updated copytree output into a new conversation with your AI assistant, then ask for targeted modifications. For example:

    ```text
    Here is my current project code:
    [Paste copytree output here]

    Can you update the Header to use a sticky navigation bar that remains fixed at the top as the user scrolls?
    ```

3. **Implement and Review:**

   Replace the affected component code with the revised version, then test and visually inspect the changes in your browser.

4. **Repeat as Needed:**

   Continue iterating with focused, component-level feedback (e.g., “I like the layout in variation 2, but please use a different font for the navigation links”) until you achieve the desired design.

---

### 3.4. Component-Focused Refinement

1. **Isolate Components for Focused Iteration:**

   For granular refinements, isolate individual components and share only that portion of the code with your AI assistant.

    ```text
    Here is the current Header component code:
    [Paste Header.svelte code]

    Please generate three design variations that:
    1. Use an alternative font for the navigation links.
    2. Include a site logo on the left.
    3. Feature a distinct, mobile-friendly hamburger menu.
    ```

2. **Review and Combine Variations:**

   Evaluate the proposed designs, then ask for a merged version incorporating your favorite elements.

    ```text
    I like the logo placement in variation 2 and the font style in variation 1. Can you combine these elements? Also, please enlarge the hamburger menu icon and adjust its color to a darker gray for better contrast.
    ```

3. **Integrate the Final Component:**

   Once satisfied, merge the final version into your project.

---

### 3.5. Tailwind CSS Configuration Refinement

1. **Share Your Current Configuration:**

   Provide your `tailwind.config.js` file to your AI assistant:

    ```text
    Here's my tailwind.config.js:
    [Paste file content]

    I’d like to refine the color palette to better match a minimalist, photography-focused aesthetic. Can you suggest a cohesive set of colors and font pairings?
    ```

2. **Iterate on Design System Elements:**

   Ask for proposals on typography, spacing scales (e.g., an 8px baseline grid), and custom shadow or elevation systems.

3. **Apply and Evaluate:**

   Update your configuration with the suggestions and test the visual impact across your design.

---

### 3.6. Backend Integration with +server.js

1. **Define API Requirements:**

   Clearly describe the data needs for dynamic components, such as project listings or interactive elements.

    ```text
    I need an API endpoint to fetch a list of projects for the Home page grid. The endpoint should support optional filtering and sorting, returning objects with a title, description, image URLs, and a details link.
    ```

2. **Generate API Files:**

   Ask your AI assistant to generate a SvelteKit `+server.js` file with appropriate data fetching logic, error handling, and response formatting.

    ```text
    Can you generate a +server.js file for the /api/projects endpoint as described? Assume data is fetched from a hypothetical CMS.
    ```

3. **Integrate and Iterate:**

   Update your Svelte components to fetch data using SvelteKit’s `load` function, and refine the API design as necessary based on testing and feedback.

---

### 3.7. Creating Targeted Rulesets for AI

If your project exceeds the AI’s context window, create targeted rulesets (see [Rulesets Documentation](./rulesets.md)) to segment your project into manageable sections. This ensures your AI assistant receives focused context for each design iteration.

---

## 4. Example: Refining the Header Component

### 4.1. Isolating the Component

- **Dedicated AI Session:**
  Start a new conversation with your AI assistant (Claude or ChatGPT) using only the Header component code along with a brief design brief.

    ```text
    Here is the current Header component code:
    [Paste Header.svelte code]

    I’d like to explore alternative designs for the Header. Please generate three variations that:
    1. Use an alternative font for the navigation links.
    2. Include a site logo on the left.
    3. Implement a distinct, mobile-friendly hamburger menu.
    ```

### 4.2. Reviewing and Iterating

- **Evaluate Options:**
  Compare the proposed designs and provide targeted feedback.

    ```text
    I like the logo placement in variation 2 and the font style in variation 1. Could you merge these elements? Also, please increase the size of the hamburger menu icon and adjust its color to a darker gray for improved contrast.
    ```

- **Integrate Final Design:**
  Once satisfied, update your `Header.svelte` with the final version.

---

## 5. Best Practices

- **Begin with a Broad Vision:** Start with overall layout and direction before focusing on individual components.
- **Maximize Context:** Run copytree frequently to provide your AI assistant with the most current and relevant code context.
- **Isolate Components:** Work on individual components separately to minimize unintended side effects.
- **Iterative Feedback Loops:** Embrace short cycles of design, review, and refinement.
- **Experiment and Compare:** Request multiple design variations to explore diverse ideas.
- **Provide Specific, Constructive Feedback:** Clearly detail your preferences and required changes to guide the AI.
- **Establish a Consistent Design System:** Use Tailwind CSS configurations to maintain a unified look across the project.
- **Version Control and Document:** Regularly commit changes and document design decisions to maintain a clear project history.
